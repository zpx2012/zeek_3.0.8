0.3.1 | 2020-02-22 16:03:24 -0800

  * Release v0.3.1

  * Replace non-standard variable-length-array usage in benchmark (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Set pattern ID type in AhoCorasickPlus::addPattern (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Else there's potential for invalid memory accesses, e.g. if the memory
    for pattern ID type happens to be equal to the "string" ID type and then
    it accesses the associated union field which hasn't been initialized.

  * Fix use-after-free bug (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The default assumption of AhoCorasick::addPattern() was that the memory
    used to store pattern strings is available for the entire lifetime of
    the process, but Paraglob initialization was passing in temporary
    std::string objects.

0.3 | 2019-09-30 21:07:37 -0700

  * Re-organize and install all paraglob header files (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Moves all paraglob headers into include/paraglob and installs them.
    Also shortened some filenames since they'll be included via paraglob
    subdirectory now, like "paraglob/paraglob.h".

    Moves ahocorasick headers into src/ since they're not part of the
    public API.

  * Forward declare AhoCorasickPlus in paraglob.h (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Such that it becomes an implementation detail and no longer requires
    installation of ahocorasick headers along with paraglob's.

  * Remove empty paraglob.h (Jon Siwek, Corelight)
